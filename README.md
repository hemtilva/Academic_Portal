The portal is designed to clear students’ doubts and improve instruction effectiveness through structured communication and data-driven insights. It supports three distinct user roles, each with dedicated functionalities.

### **Students**

Post academic doubts via a chatbox interface
Attach media files (images, documents, etc.) along with queries
Communicate directly with instructors regarding their doubts

### **Professors**

View all doubts submitted by students
Respond to doubts directly or assign them to a Teaching Assistant (TA)
Monitor overall student difficulty patterns across topics

### **Teaching Assistants (TAs)**

View only the doubts assigned to them by professors
Resolve student queries through a dedicated one-to-one chatbox

Before each lecture, the collected student doubts are processed through a machine learning model that analyzes them to identify the topics students find most confusing or challenging. Based on this analysis, the instructor can decide which topics need to be revisited or reinforced in the next lecture.
